This is my adapter for mounting the Hero Me Gen6 to the Anycubic Kobra. The files are in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) format, assembled with the [Assembly4](https://wiki.freecad.org/Assembly4_Workbench) workbench and using parts from the [Fasteners Workbench](https://wiki.freecad.org/Fasteners_Workbench).
